									<p>My career goal is to become a professional software developer with a strong foundation in both logical problem-solving and real-world application design. Iâ€™m particularly interested in roles that involve backend development, systems programming, or software for embedded or secure systems. I enjoy building tools and applications that serve practical functions, from managing data to supporting decision-making and I'm motivated by work that challenges my logic, maths, and coding skills.

										&nbsp;</p>
									<p>I've determined the essential technical and professional abilities required to thrive in the tech sector based on both guest lectures and my own research utilizing resources like Prospects.ac.uk, LinkedIn, and the BCS Career Pathways.  Strong programming skills, logical problem-solving abilities, good teamwork and communication skills, and a dedication to professionalism and lifelong learning are a few of these.</p>

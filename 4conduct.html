										<h2>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h2>
										<p>
										  Throughout this module and in my wider studies. I have consciously aligned my behaviour 
										  with the principles of the BCS Code of Conduct, especially the requirements to 
										  “act with integrity,” “maintain professional competence,” and “have regard for the public interest.”
										</p>
									  
										<ul>
										  <li>
											<strong>Integrity & Academic Honesty:</strong><br>
											I met every deadline for proposals, labs, and assignments; I always acknowledged any external 
											sources or code snippets I used; and I wrote all reflections and reports in my own words 
											to avoid both plagiarism and self‑plagiarism.
										  </li>
										  <li>
											<strong>Professional Competence:</strong><br>
											I attended several lab sessions and industry lectures, actively sought feedback on my C++ projects, 
											and invested time in extra CPD activities—such as Git and HTML/CSS courses, to ensure my skills 
											remain current and relevant.
										  </li>
										  <li>
											<strong>Respect for Colleagues & Teamwork:</strong><br>
											In group assignments, I communicated my progress clearly, 
											merged code responsibly via GitHub, and offered help when peers encountered debugging 
											challenges, demonstrating courtesy, reliability, and collaboration.
										  </li>
										  <li>
											<strong>Public Interest & Ethical Behaviour:</strong><br>
											When simulating “employee data” in my HR Management System, I treated it sensitively, never 
											hard coding personal details or exposing confidential information and I wrote clear documentation 
											so that others could safely use and extend my code.
										  </li>
										  <li>
											<strong>Continual Reflection:</strong><br>
											After each industry lecture and workshop, I completed the provided reflection templates 
											to capture key lessons on ethics, professionalism, and effective communication, then used those 
											insights to guide my behaviour in subsequent tasks.
										  </li>
										</ul>
									  
										<p>
										  By living these ideals day to day acting honestly, keeping my technical competency sharp, collaborating 
										  respectfully, and always considering how my work affects others, I’ve developed not just stronger 
										  coding skills but also the professional character expected of a computing graduate entering the workplace.
										</p>
